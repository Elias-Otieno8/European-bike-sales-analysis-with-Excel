In this data analysis project, I processed over 1,000 records of European bike sales data using Microsoft Excel. After performing thorough data cleaning within the spreadsheet, I leveraged Excel's pivot table functionality to organize and summarize the information effectively. The key focus was on examining the relationship between bike purchases and customer income, segmented by gender. Utilizing Excel's charting capabilities, I created a stacked bar chart that clearly illustrates the average income of bike purchasers versus non-purchasers, with distinct groupings for male and female customers. This Excel-based visualization enables quick identification of income-related patterns in bike-buying behavior across genders, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies and product positioning.
